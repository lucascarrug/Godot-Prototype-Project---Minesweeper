# Godot-Prototype-Project---Minesweeper
<p>This repository is a recreation of the well-known game Minesweeper, with a few changes but similar features to the original.</p>
<br>

## Notes
<p>Since the game is simple, all the Minesweeper logic is contained in a single script, which might make it harder to follow.</p>
<p>As I'm not very experienced with UIs, the UI code is kept simple and is not highly optimized.</p>
<p>In addition, I designed the .png assets myself, but the text font comes from https://www.dafont.com/es/segment7.font</p>
